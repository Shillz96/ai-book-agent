## üìä Monitoring & Control

### Dashboard URLs
- **Frontend Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- **Autonomous Status**: http://localhost:5000/api/autonomous/status

### Key Endpoints for Monitoring

```bash
# Check if autonomous operation is running
GET /api/autonomous/status

# Get current budget status
GET /api/budget/status

# Get budget forecast
GET /api/budget/forecast

# Generate weekly report manually
POST /api/reports/weekly

# Get Google Analytics metrics
POST /api/analytics/marketing-metrics"
{
  "start_date": "2024-01-01", 
  "end_date": "2024-01-31"
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Token Limit Protection

This system includes multiple safeguards to prevent the token limit issues your client experienced:

### 1. **Efficient API Usage**
- Batched API calls to minimize requests
- Smart caching to avoid redundant calls
- Rate limiting built into all services
- Async processing for non-blocking operations

### 2. **Chunked Data Processing**
```python
# Example: Analytics data is processed in chunks
def process_analytics_data_efficiently(self, large_dataset):
    chunk_size = 100  # Process 100 records at a time
    for chunk in self.chunk_data(large_dataset, chunk_size):
        self.process_chunk(chunk)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Prevent rate limiting
```

### 3. **Smart Content Generation**
- Content is generated in batches with delays
- Templates are reused to minimize AI API calls
- Performance history is cached to reduce analysis calls

### 4. **Emergency Throttling**
- Automatic slowdown when approaching rate limits
- Emergency pause mechanisms for critical situations
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## üí∞ Budget Management Features

### Autonomous Budget Controls
- **Real-time monitoring**: Tracks spending every hour
- **Alert system**: Warns at 80% budget utilization
- **Emergency stop**: Auto-pauses campaigns at 95% utilization
- **Smart reallocation**: Moves budget from low-performing to high-performing platforms

### Budget Optimization Algorithm
```python
# The system automatically:
1. Analyzes ROI by platform (Google Ads, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest)
2. Calculates performance scores based on conversions
3. Reallocates budget to highest-performing channels
4. Maintains 5% minimum allocation per platform for testing
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Autonomous services not available"
```bash
# Solution: Check that all required environment variables are set
python -c "from backend.config.settings import Config; print(Config.validate_config())"
```

**Issue**: "Google Analytics service not available"
```bash
# Solution: Verify credentials file path and permissions
ls -la /path/to/google-analytics-credentials.json
```

**Issue**: "Budget optimization not working"
```bash
# Solution: Check that Google Analytics is configured and collecting data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/marketing-metrics"
```

### Performance Optimization

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Rotate API keys every 90 days
# Monitor API usage to detect anomalies
```

### Budget Protection
```bash
# Set conservative emergency thresholds initially
EMERGENCY_STOP_THRESHOLD=0.90  # Start with 90% instead of 95%

# Enable all budget alerts
BUDGET_ALERT_THRESHOLD=0.75   # Get early warnings

# Review budget daily for first week
# Then weekly once system is stable
```

## üìû Support and Maintenance

### Daily Health Checks
```bash
# Check system status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Verify autonomous operation
curl http://localhost:5000/api/autonomous/status

# Monitor budget utilization
curl http://localhost:5000/api/budget/status
```

### Weekly Maintenance
1. Review weekly reports for insights
