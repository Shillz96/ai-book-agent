# Project Overview: Autonomous AI Book Marketing Agent

## Client Goal
To build an autonomous AI agent to market the book "Unstoppable - the young athlete's guide to rock solid mental strength" with the primary goal of generating sales on Amazon and Audible. The agent should be self-managing, continuously learning, and optimize marketing spend within a defined budget.

## Core Requirements

- **Primary Goal**: Drive consistent book sales.
- **Autonomy**: Manage and execute a full-scale marketing strategy, continuously learn and adapt, reallocate resources, track and analyze metrics, generate reports, and refine strategy.
- **Channels**: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest (daily posts), Google Ads.
- **Integrations**: Google Analytics, Google Ads account.
- **Budget**: Operate within and adjust a predefined monthly marketing budget.
- **Reporting**: Generate weekly performance reports.
- **Optimization**: Test and iterate on creative formats, sales funnels, landing pages, audience segments, and pricing.
- **Branding**: Stay on-brand, targeting youth athletes, parents, and coaches with emotionally resonant messaging.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Capability for approvals or strategy tweaks, especially in early stages.
- **Long-Term Goal**: Compounding monthly sales growth, becoming more effective over time without requiring manual input.

## Phased Approach for Rapid Development

Given the complexity, a phased development approach is highly recommended to achieve an MVP quickly and then iterate towards full autonomy.

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Automated Posting & Basic Tracking
- **Focus**: Establish core integrations for content delivery and initial data collection.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Content Generation (AI-assisted)**: Use an LLM (e.g., Gemini API) to generate social media post ideas and captions based on book themes and target audience.
    - **Scheduled Posting**: Implement automated posting to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.
    - **Basic Analytics Integration**: Connect to Google Analytics to fetch basic traffic data for the landing page.
    - **Manual Budget Input**: Allow the user to manually input the monthly budget.
    - **Simple Dashboard**: A basic UI to view generated posts, scheduled posts, and initial traffic metrics.
    - **Human-in-the-Loop (Manual Approval)**: All generated posts require manual approval before publishing.

### Phase 2: Ad Management & Enhanced Analytics
- **Focus**: Introduce paid advertising and deeper data analysis.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Google Ads Integration**: Programmatically create, manage, and optimize Google Ads campaigns.
    - **Advanced Metric Tracking**: Pull ROAS, CTR, cost per sale, and platform-specific performance data.
    - **Automated Reporting (Basic)**: Generate simple weekly reports summarizing key metrics.
    - **Budget Allocation (Rule-based)**: Implement basic rules for allocating budget.

### Phase 3: Learning, Adaptation & Full Autonomy
- **Focus**: Implement the core AI learning and optimization loop.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Performance Analysis Engine**: Develop logic to analyze combined data from various sources.
    - **Strategy Refinement (AI-driven)**: Use an LLM or rule-based system to identify and implement adjustments.
    - **A/B Testing Framework**: Automate the creation and analysis of A/B tests.
    - **Predictive Modeling (Optional)**: Incorporate models that predict content performance.
    - **Advanced Reporting**: Generate detailed, insightful weekly reports.
    - **Reduced Human-in-the-Loop**: Move towards autonomous decision-making.

### Phase 4: Scaling & Refinement
- **Focus**: Enhance robustness, scalability, and add advanced features.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Multi-Account Support**: Expand to manage multiple books/products.
    - **Advanced Content Generation**: More nuanced content adaptation.
