## 🚨 QUICK FIX FOR COMMON ERRORS

### Fix OpenAI 401 Unauthorized Errors
If you're getting "401 Unauthorized" errors, you need to configure your OpenAI API key:

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   - **Option A (Recommended)**: Use the Settings UI in the app
     - Open the app and click "Settings" 
     - Go to "OpenAI Configuration" tab
     - Enter your API key
   
   - **Option B**: Set environment variable
     - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder
     - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here`

3. **Restart the application** after setting the API key

### Other Quick Fixes
- **user_id required**: ✅ Fixed in latest code
- **Revenue analysis NoneType error**: ✅ Fixed in latest code  
- **Missing save_ab_test method**: ✅ Fixed in latest code

### Fix "Firebase service not initialized" Error

If you see this warning: *"Settings saved to Firebase but backend config update failed"*

**Quick Solution:**
1. **Create a Firebase service account** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project → Settings → Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file

2. **Set the environment variable**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\firebase-key.json"
   
   # Or add to backend/.env file:
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\path\to\your\firebase-key.json
   ```

3. **Restart the backend server**:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py
   ```

**Note:** Your app will work fine without this - it only affects backend configuration caching. The frontend saves directly to Firebase successfully.
